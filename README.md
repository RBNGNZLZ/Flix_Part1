### Notes
This assignment taught me alot about style choices, tables and cells. It was all new to me so I took some time to really digest the material. Especially how to implement controllers. The videos were a bit hard to follow since alot of the instructions were skipped over but I was able to solve most of my issues. I wasn't able to get the correct constraints in the movie title label. You can see that it gets cut off in portrait mode but in landscape it's fine.
